## Sip the tea, leave the cup
Welcome to Namgyal's Tea House! 

I am a translator-in-training under [the Kumarajiva Project](https://khyentsefoundation.org/kf-projects/kumarajiva-project/). My goal is to translate Buddhist wisdom into modern languages and share it with the world. 

On this website, you can find my writings and curated learning resources about Buddhism and the Tibetan language. 

### Why a tea house?
I am a tea person. My dad has a collection of aging Pu'er tea (much like collecting red wine), and the aroma of tangerine Pu'er instantly brings me home. In recent years, I have grown to like English tea, mainly Earl Grey and English Breakfast. And while not all tea drinkers will enjoy the savory, rich Tibetan butter tea, I quite like it for the first cup. The second cup is starting to feel like a small meal. 

There's more to the concept of tea. On multiple occasions, Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche elaborated on the relationship between Buddha Dharma and cultures. 

> The four seals are like tea, while all other means to actualize these truths—practices, rituals, traditions, and cultural trappings—are like a cup. The skills and methods are observable and tangible, but the truth is not. The challenge is not to get carried away by the cup.[^1]

I agree that students of Buddhism should remind themselves regularly that they are after the tea, not the cup. 

That said, cultures and languages provide different ways to approach the truth. Before we can make the leap to non-thought, we rely on languages to construct our mental models of reality. And by crossing the language borders, we may be able to get out of our hardened mental model and see something new. 

So Namgyal's Tea House is where I share my personal observations and reflections as I roam around different linguistic terrains and study the Buddha Dharma. 

I hope you find some small inspirations for your spiritual journey. 
### Quick Questions

1. Why is there a moon symbol in each note?

Instead of only publishing blog articles that are polished, I am experimenting with the practice of digital gardening.[^2] This means that I am sharing my thoughts as they develop.  

For transparency, I adapted the categorization method used in [Maggie Appleton's digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) to indicate the status of each note:

- 🌒 Crescent for rough ideas and thoughts
- 🌓 Quarter for work that is done and edited
- 🌕 Full moon for work that is more or less complete

If you spot a mistake in the article, please feel free to contact me. It'll be much appreciated! 

2. Why are there different notes in different languages?

Since this is meant to be a digital garden, I am not going to put on my translator hat and write everything three times - in English, Chinese, and Tibetan. 

Some topics come to my mind only in particular language contexts. So I write about them in that language. 

3. Is there a real Namgyal Tea House somewhere?

Not yet, I guess? When I registered the domain, it was up for grabs. Perhaps one day I'll open one and serve you some real tea. Send me an [email](mailto:namgyal.xw@gmail.com) and a photo if you spot one somewhere!

4.  What does Namgyal mean anyway?

Namgyal རྣམ་རྒྱལ། is my dharma name, bestowed by a Tibetan Buddhist master that I follow.  

It is the Tibetan name of [Uṣṇīṣavijayā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usnisavijaya) (佛頂尊勝佛母), one of the three deities of long life and one of the 21 Taras. The first half of the name རྣམ་པར། means 'completely' and the second half རྒྱལ་མ། is the female form of 'the victorious one.' 

When a Tibetan language teacher heard that I was bestowed this name, he said that the master must have high hopes for me. I use this name to remind myself that I better behave and do some good work. 

5. I like your website. How did you make it?

It's a work in progress. You can read more about it in [[The Making of Namgyal Tea House]].
